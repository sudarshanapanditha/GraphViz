# GraphViz

GraphViz is a program that solves the **Graph Drawing problem** using the **Force-Directed Layout** algorithm for a given Graph and visualizes it. This assignment is provided by Stanford University's **CS106L** course. Although I'm not a student or alumni of Stanford university, this is my implementation of the Force-Directed Layout algorithm that I did for fun!

## Installation

To run this program, you need Qt Creator installed with MinGW compiler
